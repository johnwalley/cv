* Visualisation: OpenGL, WebGL, D3.js, Processing, Google Earth
* Web/Mobile: Android, HTML5, AngularJS, Amazon EC2

### Technical Sales

Day-to-day familiarity with the sales process. Uncovering the customer's underlying pain points through asking the right questions. Demonstrating capabilities and successfully guiding them through an evaluation. Developing lasting relationships with customers (internal and external) as part of providing responsive customer service.

### Communication

Proven ability to adapt presentations to the technical level of the audience and comfortable presenting to large groups, for example:

* Delivered talk on computational finance to 200 quantitative analysts in Canary Wharf
* Regularly introduce solutions and tools to customers from a wide spectrum of industries using the most appropriate media, including presentations, web-conferencing, phone calls and one-to-one discussion
* Organised an annual exhibit for 14-16 year old students on behalf of MathWorks as part of Physics at Work outreach event

Employment
----------

### June 2014 - Present
#### Software Engineer, Red Gate

Solving production database deployments for users of the most popular release management tools.

### Apr 2012 - May 2014
#### Developer, SunGard

Contributing to the scalable and extensible framework which underlies the Adaptiv Analytics high-performance risk analytics service. Projects have included:

* Tracing just-in-time compiler enabling clients to run existing C# quantitative models on GPUs

### Dec 2011 - Mar 2012
#### Freelance Software Developer

Projects included:

* Designing and implementing algorithms for human motion capture using low-cost inertial sensors, e.g. accelerometers and gyroscopes. This will be incorporated into an iPhone app to aid rehabilitation post knee-surgery
* Developing a bespoke trading tool for an independent trader. The user wishes to test out strategies and ideas quickly and easily without programming. The tool must handle large amounts of data (down to the tick level) across tens of thousands of instruments. Streaming and caching approaches are being evaluated

### Nov 2010 - Aug 2011
#### Quantitative HPC Developer, Fidelity Investment Managers

As a core member of the newly founded applied research and technology team I was instrumental in designing, implementing and introducing quant-based methods to the wider organisation.

Projects typically fell into one of two categories:

* Taking new models from inception to production
* Porting existing applications, typically desktop-based Excel/VBA applications, to a standardised maintainable form

Core numerics were implemented in the high-level language MATLAB. This is the same language the quantitative analysts uses for their prototyping which facilitated quickly moving from an initial idea to a production application. I was closely involved in designing architecture and applying the appropriate design patterns.

Data was sourced from external providers - FactSet, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg - and internal systems. As part of our process data would be processed and stored in an internal Oracle database. Examples of software interfaces I developed included a Java/JSBC data access layer and a SOAP-based interface to Thomson Reuters' Datastream Web Service API.

I was responsible for source control (Subversion), continuous integration (TeamCity) and testing (xUnit-style), I promoted components of agile development to the team. These included developing a minimal viable product to help elicit earlier feedback and generally taking an iterative approach to development with more frequent stakeholder input.

### May 2008 - Nov 2010
#### Application Engineer, MathWorks

Worked directly with customers to understand their technical and business challenges. I acted as the main point of contact for customers evaluating and using MathWorks parallel computing tools in the UK. My key responsibilities included:

* Analysing users' problems to determine and implement the best solution
* Developing demos and proofs of concept
* Preparing and delivering presentations to customers and prospects
* Providing feedback to the commercial and R&D organisations and developing relationships both internally and externally

Examples of successful projects I undertook:

* led a team to develop a battlefield simulation tool in response to an interest I identified within our defence customers
* Developed new content for our regular series of one day introductory seminars targeted at new users

### 2004 - 2008
#### Research Scientist, QinetiQ

Contributed to a diverse range of projects including:

* Research into assessing and improving warship stealth
* Sensor fusion - combining radar and infra-red sensor output to improve situational awareness. Member of team which developed a 10,000 line application in C running in soft real-time. Included a socket-based interface to in-service hardware, i.e. radar on a Royal Navy Type 23 frigate
* Development of cutting-edge object tracking algorithms. Including a LIDAR simulator (C++), Markov Chain Monte Carlo tracking application (MATLAB) which I also modified to run on a cluster, and a Google Earth based visualisation tool (Python)

### Summer 1998 & 1999
#### Research Assistant, Newcastle University Physics Department

Data analysis and modelling of a mass spectrometry experiment in Fortran. Joint author of a paper; 'Hyperfine-resolved spectrum of the molecular dication DCL^2+^'

Education
---------

### 2002 - 2003
#### Oriel College, University of Oxford

##### MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing

Modules studied included mathematical modelling, numerical linear algebra, numerical optimisation and distributed computing for computational finance. Dissertation explored the numerical solution of magnetic fluid flow.

### 1999 - 2002
#### Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge

##### BA in Mathematics (2.1)

Studied a wide variety of topics. Emphasis on applied mathematics, statistics and theoretical physics.

Interests
---------

Rowing, coxing and running my local rowing club's website
